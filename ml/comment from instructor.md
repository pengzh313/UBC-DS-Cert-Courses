The below was the comment from the course instructor regarding the final ML project submitted by Peng
Notes: 1. Add transparency to plots. 2. Turn verbose off as it yields unneeded text. I always tell people that if they manage to figure out how to not drop the text features, I will automatically give them a 100%. You are the first student in one year that has actually achieved so. Actually, the way that you did in the assignments is extremely competent. Usually, people don't work with mixed features, either you work with text or with the other metadata. A lot of analysts choose to not "deal" with mixed features. However, what you achieved, not dropping anything, is extremely important because text might actually have very important information but so does all other metadata. Probably in this problem, using only metadata would yield a better result - current high of 93% on the test set, but there are many other problems (classifying github repositories) that might need that you take into consideration the text (readme files) and the metadata (forks, commits, etc) I am actually super proud to see that you figure out how to submit things properly.
