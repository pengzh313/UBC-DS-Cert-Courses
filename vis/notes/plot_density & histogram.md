The below discussion between Peng and the course instructor was for ***Assignment 3 Q 4.6***

**Question**: For Question 4.6 of Assignment 3, the released solution shows the answer is C: layered_histogram_plot that best answers the original question: Do films generating revenue in the top 10%, produce higher received films by voting average?

My answer was D density_plot (see the plot as below). The question is focusing on comparing the blockbusters with not top 10% films to find out which group received a higher "voting average" score. From the density plot, the blockbusters' area chart is more towards to right than the distribution of the not top 10% films. Particularly the density plot shows two peaks of the two groups' distribution, and it is visually easier to see the peak of the blockbusters' area chart is on the right side of the not top 10% films'. In my opinion, although the layered histogram plot can also answer the question directly, the density plot is more like a further processed way to have a better visualization specific to the question.Â

**Answer**: I think ultimately here it comes down to the fact that with a Histogram you are looking directly at counts of your data, whereas in the density plots there has been some smoothing and data prediction calculations that have been done to produce the curves.

Yes, looking at the density plots is easier to see the peaks of data distribution, but in the histogram you can better see the exact distribution of your data. In the histogram it is easier to see a bigger skew in the blockbuster data is definitely showing toward the higher voting averages, whereas the not top 10% data has more of a normal distribution with the majority of data definitely further to the left and lower voter averages.

In conclusion, I think that you can see the tails of the distribution of your data better in the histogram to better understand the distribution shapes. The density plot is extrapolation beyond what is in your data and is also hiding the sample size information and exact data.
