The below discussion between Peng and the course instructor regarding Assignment #7 Q3.2

**Question**: What is the consideration that we need to make a background plot in this case? I cannot tell the difference on the created players_map whether we utilize the background plot or not.

**Answer**: For this type of graph, you are correct they still look exactly the same. I think the point is to establish a consistent way to set-up maps. First set-up the background, then add the second layer, etc.

In this case it doesnâ€™t make a difference, but if you have the coloured states, and then mapped capital city location or population for each state, then having the first layer of the grey map here allows for all the layers of the map to be aligned to one shared system based on the first layer.

The first layer also is good as a check that your data is set-up correctly. What if the second layer of coloured states was not aligned properly - it might then cause you to go double check that you have the correct coordinate data in your starting data set and help catch the error.
